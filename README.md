# dnd_random_generation_tools
These utilities will use python and Excel tables to generate loot and perform other functions that are useful for Dungeon Masters. 

I’ve chosen to use Excel files over other data storage so that a user can easily edit the tables and add more content if they wish. In this same spirit, the coding involved will be constructed such a way that it is easily readable for novices.

It is my intent to expand this toolset to perform a variety of functions listed in the Dungeon Master’s guide. It will also be filled with utilities that I use in my own campaigns to simulate activities and events. 

If you download this, I hope it serves you well. Feel free to message me with questions or if you want contribute to the project. If you want to use the content here, I request you credit myself and provide a link to the repository.

Code Notes:

- gem_entry_interpreter function in hoard_reward_roll.py: I tried to keep out of the strictly number based indexing of columns for readability's sake, but this one merited using index based searches.
