# dnd_random_generation_tools
 An assortment of Excel tables and Python files to automate table rolls

These utilities will use python and Excel tables to generate loot and perform other functions that I think are useful for Dungeon Masters. 

I’ve chosen to use Excel files over other data storage so that a user can easily edit the tables and add more content if they wish. In this same spirit, the coding involved will be constructed such that it is easily readable for novices.

It is my intent to expand this toolset to perform a variety of functions listed in the Dungeon Master’s guide. It will also be filled with utilities that I use in my own campaigns to simulate activities and events. 

If you download this, I hope it serves you well. Feel free to message me with questions or if you want to be a part of this project. If you want to use the content here, I request you credit myself and provide a link to the repository.

Hoard Treasure tables
The Gem and Art object tables are expanded such that a single roll can be used. 

Gem Table: Expanded to 24 rows instead of 12, 8, 6, and 4 entries. The entries for the tables duplicated, preserving the original probability.

Art Object Table: Expanded to 40 rows instead of 10 and 8. The entries for the tables duplicated, preserving the original probability
